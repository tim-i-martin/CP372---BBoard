This was a group project completed for a networking course.

At a high level this was an implementation of a bulletin board stored on a server where clients had the ability to store notes on said bulleting board.
The project was completed using the stream socket API of Java.  

The server constraints:
- accept multiple connections
- process information from the clients

Client side:
- needed to have a GUI

We were able to establish our protocol as we desired to best make this work.
